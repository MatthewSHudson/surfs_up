## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to succinctly describe the weather on O'ahu during the summer and winter months. This was analysis used daily weather data pulled from 9 stations spread across the island from the Jan. 1 2010 to Aug. 23 2017.

## Results 
The main differences between the winter and summer seasonal weather on O'ahu are:
1. The coldest day on record in the winter is substantially colder than the coldest day on record in the summer
1. The bottom quartile, median, mean, and third quartile all shift up by 3-4 degrees farenheit in the summer, so the average day in december is not too much colder than a similarily average day in june.
1. While the observerd temperatures in December do have a higher degree of spread (indicated by the standard deviation) there is not a very significant change in standard deviation between the two months. This, along with point 2, indicates that the the observed tempertures probably come from a similar distribution that simply shifts up 3-4 degrees in the summer.

The above claims are supported by the summary DataFrame which can be viewed below:
